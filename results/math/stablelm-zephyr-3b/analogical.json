The relevant problems are as follows:\n\n1) Q: How many positive integers less than or equal to n have an odd square?\nA: To solve this problem, we first need to understand that an integer has an odd square if and only if it is a perfect square of an odd prime number. We can find the count of such numbers by considering the prime factorization of n and finding the count of odd primes less than or equal to n/2.\nFinal answer: (count of odd primes) * 2\n\n2) Q: Find the largest multiple of 8 that is less than 100.\nA: To solve this problem, we can divide 100 by 8 and find the quotient and remainder.

The first term in this case is 1 and the last term is 2n. Since the sequence consists of consecutive odd numbers, the last term will be twice as large as the first term plus n.\nFinal answer: Sn = (n/2)(1 + 2n)",

In this case, for n = 4, the answer would be (4 * (2*4 - 1)) / 2 = 10.\n\n2) Q (Problem 2): If a number is at most T multiplied by its reverse, then it is at most T times the greatest integer less than or equal to its reverse. What is the largest value of T that can be achieved?\nA (Solution to Problem 2): Let's consider an example with T = 10 and the number 1234. The reverse of this number is 4321. According to the problem, if a number is at most T multiplied by its reverse, then it is at most T times the greatest integer less than or equal to its reverse. So, for T = 10, we have (1234 * 4321) <= (10 * 4321). The largest value of T that can be achieved in this case is 10 * 4321 = 42310.\n\n3) Q (Problem 3): If a number n is represented as the sum of two numbers a and b, where both a and b are between 1 and \u221an, then find the maximum possible value of n.\nA (Solution to Problem 3): To find the maximum possible value of n, we need to maximize the values of a and b. Since both a and b should be less than or equal to \u221an, their sum should also not exceed \u221an. Therefore, the maximum possible value of n would be the largest possible product between a and b that does not exceed \u221an. For example, if we let a = 2 and b = \u221a3 (both are within the range), then the sum is 5 (2 + \u221a3). Since this sum is less than or equal to \u221a5, it represents the maximum possible value of n.\n\nNow, let's solve the initial problem:\nThe list of numbers [20, 57, 89, 12, 37, 68, 94] has an even number at index 2 (12), 4 (68), and 6 (94).

Q: What is the next number in the sequence: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9? \nA: The sequence follows an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 2. To find the next term, we add 2 to the previous term (7) and get 9. Therefore, the next term in the sequence would be 11.\n\n2. Q: A car is traveling at 60 mph for 3 hours. How far did it travel? \nA: To calculate the distance traveled, multiply the speed by time. In this case, the speed remains constant (60 mph), and we have to find the time spent traveling (3 hours). So, the distance = Speed \u00d7 Time = 60 mph \u00d7 3 hours = 180 miles.\n\n3. Q: A rectangular garden has dimensions of 20 meters by 30 meters.

In this case, the first term is 29, the last term is 33, and there are 6 odd numbers in the list (29, 71, 41, 73, 79, 33).\n- Using the formula, we get: Sn = (6/2)(29 + 33) = 15(62) = 930.\n- Therefore, the sum of the odd numbers in the given list is 930.",
