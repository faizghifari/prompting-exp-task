Here are three relevant math problems that may help us solve the initial problem:\nRelevant Problem 1: What is the product of the numbers in even indices in the 0-indexed list [3, 15, 72, 91, 44, 10, 27]?\nQ: Describe this problem.\nA: This problem is similar to the initial problem, but it involves finding the product of the numbers in even indices instead of the odd indices. To solve this problem, we can use the same approach as before, which is to multiply each number in the list by its index (0, 2, 4, 6, etc.). The final answer will be [1, 30, 288, 359, 176, 20, 54].\nRelevant Problem 2: If Sally has 3 times as many pencils as John, and they together have 150 pencils, how many pencils does each of them have?\nQ: Describe this problem.\nA: This problem involves a simple multiplication situation where we need to find the number of pencils each person has by multiplying the total number of pencils (150) by the ratio of Sally's pencils to John's pencils. If Sally has 3 times as many pencils as John, that means she has 3/4 of the total pencils, and John has 1/4 of the total pencils. So, if we multiply 150 by 3/4, we get 90, and if we multiply 150 by 1/4, we also get 37.5. Therefore, Sally has 90 pencils, and John has 37.5 pencils.\nRelevant Problem 3: A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 books. If the bookshelf is currently empty, how many books can be placed on it in total?\nQ: Describe this problem.\nA: This problem involves finding out the total number of books that can be placed on a bookshelf with 5 shelves by multiplying the number of shelves by the number of books each shelf can hold. Since each shelf can hold 8 books, we can multiply 5 by 8 to get 40 books in total.\nNow, let's apply these relevant problems to solve the initial problem:\nQ: Copy and paste the initial problem here.\nA: To solve this problem, we need to find the product of the numbers in odd indices in the list [3, 15, 72, 91, 44, 10, 27]. We can do this by multiplying each number by its index (0, 1, 2, 3, etc.), which gives us [3 \u00d7 0 = 0, 15 \u00d7 1 = 15, 72 \u00d7 2 = 144, 91 \u00d7 3 = 273, 44 \u00d7 4 = 176, 10 \u00d7 5 = 50, 27 \u00d7 6 = 152].

For example, 18 \u00d7 18 = 324, 71 \u00d7 71 = 5091, 86 \u00d7 86 = 7372, and so on. Therefore, the final answer is 32,400.",
