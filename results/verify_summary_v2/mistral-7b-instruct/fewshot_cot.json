Who won?\nDavid: The Tigers took the victory. Their defense was outstanding.\nAlice: Absolutely! I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.\nSummary:\nA conversation among friends discussing a recent intense sports game, with the Tigers winning due to their exceptional defense.\nAnswer:\nThe dialogue is a discussion about a sports game last night. Alice started by asking others whether they follow the game. Bob said yes, he thought it was intense then asked for Carol opinion. Carol missed the game so he did not have any opinion and rather ask for the winner. David answered that Tigers won because of their outstanding defense, which Alice also agreed.

A summary is accurate when all of its content are consistent with the dialogue. In contrast, if there is a part of the summary that is inconsistent or not supported by the dialogue, even if its only one part, then the summary is inaccurate. Answer with \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nDialogue:\nAlice: Hey, did anyone catch the game last night?\nBob: Yeah, it was intense! What did you think, Carol?\nCarol: I missed it, unfortunately. Who won?\nDavid: The Tigers took the victory. Their defense was outstanding.\nAlice: Absolutely! I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.\nSummary:\nA conversation among friends discussing a recent intense sports game, with the Tigers winning due to their exceptional defense.\nAnswer:\nThe dialogue is a discussion about a sports game last night. Alice started by asking others whether they follow the game. Bob said yes, he thought it was intense then asked for Carol opinion. Carol missed the game so he did not have any opinion and rather ask for the winner. David answered that Tigers won because of their outstanding defense, which Alice also agreed. The summary accurately reflects the dialogue's essence, mentioning the discussion about a thrilling sports game, the query about the winning team, and praise for the Tigers' defense. So, the answer is Yes.\n\nDialogue:\nEmma: I can't believe it's already December!\nJack: Yeah, time flies. Did you hear about the new restaurant opening up downtown?\nSophia: No, I haven't. What's it called?\nOliver: It's called 'Gourmet Delights.' I've heard they have fantastic seafood dishes.\nEmma: That sounds amazing! We should plan to go there soon.\nSummary:\nFriends discussing the arrival of December and planning to visit a new seafood restaurant called 'Gourmet Delights.'\nAnswer:\nFirst, the dialogue started by Emma stated she cannot believe its already December, which immediately followed by Jack agreement. Jack then asked the others about whether they hear about a new restaurant. Sophia have not heard it, but Oliver knew the restaurant, named 'Gourmet Delights'. He also heard that the restaurant have fantastic seafood dishes. Emma sounds excited and suggested to plan to go there. The summary falsely describes the dialogue, attributing significance to December's arrival and plans to visit a new restaurant. However, if we understand the dialogue closely, the actual dialogue is about the perception of time passing quickly and discussing a restaurant's name and reputation, not planning to visit the restaurant. The visitation plan was only a suggestion from Emma and still not discussed by the others. So, the answer is No.\n\nDialogue:\nAiden: Did you guys see the latest gadget release?\nZoe: I saw it online. People seem excited about its features.\nMila: I'm considering getting it.
